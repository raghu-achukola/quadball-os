### Quadball DBT

DBT project to generate analytical views in Snowflake
DBT + Snowflake is ~~probably~~ _definitely_ overkill for the task at hand,  but at our scale and infrequent usage, costs should stay low, and the ability during development to quickly iterate with confidence is useful. 

We will use this to also ensure that our data's referential integrity is maintained through many manual statsheet entries.
